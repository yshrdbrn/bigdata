# Analyzing Criminal Acts In The City of Montreal

## Abstract
In this report, we focus on finding spatial and temporal criminal hotspots. We analyze the dataset from the city of Montreal and our goal is to find criminal patterns and predict potential criminal types. This report would help people living in the city to be more aware of criminal activities in different neighborhoods and would help the police to put more/less patrol in certain areas of the city.
