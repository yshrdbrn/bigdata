# Analyzing Criminal Acts In The City of Montreal

## Abstract
In this report, we focus on finding spatial and temporal criminal hotspots. We analyze the dataset from the city of Montreal and our goal is to find criminal patterns and predict potential criminal types. We are going to use Decision Tree classifier and Na√Øve Bayesian classifier in order to predict potential crime types. This report would help the people living in Montreal to be more aware of criminal activities in different neighbourhoods and would help the police to predict future crimes in a specific location within a particular time therefore  helping them to put more/less patrol in certain areas of the city at a particular time.
